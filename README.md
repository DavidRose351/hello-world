Hello Out There!

My name is Dave, I am from Australia, I am using GITHub for the first time.

I work Full-Time in retail management and study I.T part time through RMIT University all while raising a young family consisting of two amazing little boys ands my beautiful wife.

I am entering my second year units at University and right now at this point enjoy programming in Java and anything
to do with Networking.
